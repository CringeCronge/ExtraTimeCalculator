This is a small hobby project I made in Godot to help my school's Learning Support Department, it was also an excuse to learn how signals work in C# and to practice UI/Control nodes.

For those that just want the executible file, dowload the Windows Export folder and all should be fine!
This is just a simple mock up, that I made update if I remeber this project exists...
